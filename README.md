_Sessile_ is a further exploration of "minimal" finger travel.

## 🤔 What Even Is 'Minimal Finger Travel' Anyway?

Probably the least amount of finger travel would be not moving them at all. That
would be 10 keys...

```math
combos_{10\,keys} = \sum_{r=1}^{10} C(10, r) = 1023
```

...yielding **1023** possible combinations.

More realistically, we might consider excluding cross hand combinations so that
modifiers might be used. That would give us

```math
combos_{5\,keys} = \sum_{r=1}^{5} C(5, r) = 31
```

So, with only 5 keys on both hands, and no cross hand combos, we would have a
total of **62** possible keys per layer—more than sufficient.

I wasn't quite ready to take on learning to type on that though, so just
avoiding lateral reaches seemed like a start. 🙃

## ✨ Features

- 🧩 Sessile uses
  [KLP-Lame keycaps](https://github.com/braindefender/KLP-Lame-Keycaps). Larger
  caps may be tight, especially on the bottom row. I was lazy and didn't model
  the tilted keycaps in the rendering, but they're much nicer for the vertical
  combos.

- 🔋 Uses battery LIR1254. **DO NOT substitute LR44.**

- 🔌 The high speed pins were left available for encoders and _could_ be wired
  in a subsequent revision.

- ⚙️ Built for RMK. Configure using [Vial](https://get.vial.today).

## 🏠 Case

A 3D printable case is available in the
[latest release](https://github.com/willpuckett/sessile/releases/latest)! The
case is designed to sit as low as possible and can be secured with a stroke of
glue stick underneath. Case is generated via ergogen with jscad v2 api.
[Try it out](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen/pull/159) it's testing 10-20x
faster than @jscad/cli@1.

## 🎨 Origin

_Sessile_ was produced using
[studyofhands](https://github.com/willpuckett/studyofhands).

## 🚀 Firmware

This board is designed for RMK. 😏

### 🦀 RMK

Current RMK build is available in the
[Releases](https://github.com/willpuckett/sessile/releases/latest).

You can build the firmware yourself by cloning this repository and running

```bash
cd rmk && cargo make uf2 --release
```

> [!TIP]
> If you haven't previously used Rust to build software for nRF52840, you may
> need to follow the
> [Setup RMK Environment](https://rmk.rs/guide/user_guide/2-2_local_compilation#setup-rmk-environment)
> instructions.
